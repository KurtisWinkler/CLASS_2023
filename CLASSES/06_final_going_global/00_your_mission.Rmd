# Your mission should you choose to accept it 

There is an enormous amount of data in ENCODE that 
needs to be analyzed. This includes 480 unique DBP
ChIPseq datasets. To facilitate your mission we provide you
1,066 peak files that have been run through the NF_CORE chipseq
pipeline. 

You will find all the .broadPeak peak files here:
/scratch/Shares/rinnclass/CLASS_2023/data/data/peaks


Use what you have learned in class to uncover
new results from this daunting data set. 

# Good luck the genome depends on you!

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
